# Coursera Machine Learning

This repository regroups the code resources of the Coursera online course Machine Learning (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). It is dispensed by Andrew Ng. 

Please find below the link of the certification that shows the quality of the code in the files: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/9K8DE8HERFUG. 
The missing points are because of the Octave theoretical quiz which I always missed. 

If you are stuck at some points for this course I deeply recommend you to use the resources of the forums available on the Coursera platform. Most of the time you are not the first to face some difficulties.
